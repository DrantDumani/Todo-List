# Todo-List

This is a Todo List app created by following the curriculum on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list). It's themed around encouraging users to store tasks that are not strictly work related, aiming to help strike a work / life balance.

This webapp uses localStorage, storing user data through cookies when allowed. It functions on both mobile and desktop.

A modular approach was taken with this project, in order to separate responsibilities.

## Technologies used

HTML, SCSS, Webpack, Javascript

## Bugs

-Task Deletion does not work correctly when logged in

-Editing tasks is bugged. Sometimes, a task will not be edited after filling in the modal. Clicking the cancel button seems to edit the task anyway
