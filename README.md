# Todo-List

This is a Todo List app created by following the curriculum on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list). It's themed around encouraging users to store tasks that are not strictly work related, aiming to help strike a work / life balance.

This webapp uses localStorage, storing user data through cookies when allowed. It functions on both mobile and desktop.

A modular approach was taken with this project, in order to separate responsibilities.
